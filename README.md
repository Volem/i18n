# Node.js Internationalization

## About

The Node.js i18n Working Group is dedicated to the support and improvement of both Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n) within the [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) project. This Working Group serves as a function of the [Node.js Community Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee).

#### What we're responsible for
* The ongoing translation of the [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) project's textual content into every language of its users.
* The implementation of i18n support including [ECMA-402](https://tc39.github.io/ecma402/) within [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node). 
* Ensuring Node.js is compliant with common standards like [Unicode](https://unicode.org/), [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/), and harmonized with other globalization efforts.

#### What i18n (Internationalization) means to us
Maintaining the ability for Node.js to [effectively support](https://nodejs.org/api/intl.html#intl_internationalization_support) the cultural & socio-linguistic preferences of all international users, through:
* [Unicode](https://unicode.org) processing and related services to support text written in all human languages.
* APIs and implementations which support the specific cultural & socio-linguistic preferences, such as localized methods for displaying dates & times.
* The ability for [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) and its related modules & applications to be translated into distinct human languages.

#### What l10n (Localization) means to us
* Making the Node.js project's API documentation, site, and tutorial content available in every language.
* The responsibility to provide translators with a useful platform to work in.
* The responsibility to provision Node.js with all l10n assets, through coordination with [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) core contributors.
* Members of this group are not responsible for performing the act of translation itself.

## Summary of our Responsibilities
1. Supporting l10n groups who are actively translating the content of [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) into their own languages.
2. i18n support for [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), and its related initiatives.
3. Ensuring i18n compliance with all relevant standards such as [Unicode](https://unicode.org) and [ECMA-402](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402).
4. Continual refinement and maintenance of the i18n Working Group's processes, platform service accounts, and related module repositories & source code.

### Our Current Trajectory
Please read [this article](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/internationalizing-node-js-fe7761798b0a) to get up to speed on our current trajectory.


## Inter-project relationships
In order to ensure best practices, this working group may work directly with representatives of similar and related i18n efforts from other external projects. For example:
* [Electron i18n](https://github.com/electron/electron-i18n)
* [W3C i18n Working Group](https://www.w3.org/International/core/Overview)
* [ECMA-402](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402) (Together with ECMA-262, specifies the i18n features of JavaScript)
* [V8 i18n](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/i18n-support) (implements ECMA-402 in Node.js)
* [Unicode](https://unicode.org):
  - [The Unicode Standard](https://unicode.org/standard/) (defines how text is encoded)
  - [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org) (Common Locale Data Repository)
  - [ICU](http://icu-project.org) (C/C++ i18n library used by v8 and Node.js)
